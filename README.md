### Description of the project
We will create Space Invaders using java and JavaFX. The “minimum viable product” will be developed using various tutorials and resources on the internet. Once we have an initial version of the product, we will continue to develop it and put our own spin on it. We will generate ideas for how the game should work (game design), find suitable classes and methods, and implement these in java and JavaFX.

The initial product will include core features such as the ability to move the space ship horizontally, shoot and destroy enemy spaceships, gain points when destroying enemies, weapon upgrades, and losing when colliding with an enemy. Other features we might implement include: progressing to a new level once a certain score has been reached; bosses once the player reaches a certain level; have enemies that move in different patterns; change the look of the GUI and enemies so that the player gets the feeling that he or she is fighting in different solar systems; etc..

The goal is to have a playable, fun, and reasonably complex version of Space Invaders.
